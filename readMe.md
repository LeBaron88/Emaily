# Emaily
This is a React (client) and Node/Express (server) application that allows its users, who can login using their google account, send email surveys to a list of recipients of their choice.
It uses MongoDB to store all its data via Mongoose and once the app is loaded, Redux takes care of all state data in its store.

The production application could be found at https://gentle-river-26816.herokuapp.com
